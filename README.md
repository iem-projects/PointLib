Chord sequences can be edited by double-clicking on an individual chord of a chromosome. This toggles between unselected and selected chord. If no modifier is pressed, the chord is selected as "good" and shown in blue. Good chords are frozen and will not change in the iteration. Successive good chords will not be broken up during cross over. If the Alt key is held down during double-click, the chord is selected as "bad" and shown in red. Bad chords will be preferred as cross-over points (the cut will be located _right before_ that chord).
